# -neural-network-for-the-binary-classification
 in this paper, I Used Tensorflow 2 to train a neural network for the binary classification of cats and dogs based on images from the given data set. Images transformed from JPG to RGB (or grayscale) pixel values and scaled down. 
 Experiment with different network architectures and training parameters documenting their influence on the final predictive performance. in the end, 5-fold cross-validation was used to compute the estimated risk. the estimates computed according to the zero-one loss.
